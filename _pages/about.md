Hello! I am a PhD student at [INSAIT](https://insait.ai) supervised by [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t3A39e8AAAAJ). My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Generative AI. I am currently working on facilitating Human-AI collaboration for Software Engineering usecases.

I graduated with an Integrated Bachelors and Masters of Technology from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). My thesis on Improving legal summarization for low-resource jurisdictions was supervised by [Prof. Matthias Grabmair](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MroPEGsAAAAJ) and [Prof. Saptarshi Ghosh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7TmKZv0AAAAJ). I also took part in internships at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) and the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
