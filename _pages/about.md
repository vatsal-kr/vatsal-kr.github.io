I am a second-year PhD student at [INSAIT](https://insait.ai) and [UKP Lab](http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/) supervised by [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t3A39e8AAAAJ). My research interests lie in LLM post-training, specifically leveraging Reinforcement Learning methods align and improve language models.

I graduated with an Integrated Bachelors and Masters of Technology from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). My thesis on Improving legal summarization for low-resource jurisdictions was supervised by [Prof. Matthias Grabmair](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MroPEGsAAAAJ) and [Prof. Saptarshi Ghosh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7TmKZv0AAAAJ), and was accepted at the NAACL main conference. 

During my undergrad, I also took part in internships at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) and the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).

Outside of work, I’m usually at the gym, at the tennis court, or at a board game cafe. I also have a major soft spot for the street cats of Sofia (though the feeling is rarely mutual).
